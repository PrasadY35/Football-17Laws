    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Pitch Green -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, non-linear single-page application. The primary navigation is a grid of all 17 laws, allowing users to jump directly to any rule. The content is grouped into four logical themes: 1) The Essentials (Field, Ball, Players, Equipment), 2) Match Flow (Start/Restart, Duration, etc.), 3) Offenses & Key Rules (Fouls, Offside), and 4) The Officials. This structure is chosen over a linear report format because users interested in football rules typically want to find specific information quickly (e.g., "What's the offside rule?"). The thematic grouping makes discovery intuitive, and the interactive elements within each section (like diagrams and tabs) break down complex information into digestible pieces, enhancing usability and learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Law 1 (Field): Report Info -> Field Dimensions. Goal -> Inform. Viz -> Interactive HTML/CSS diagram with clickable zones. Interaction -> On-click tooltips show dimensions. Justification -> More engaging and spatially intuitive than a list of numbers. Method -> HTML/CSS with JS for popups.
        - Law 11 (Offside): Report Info -> Definition of offside position and offense. Goal -> Explain a complex spatial rule. Viz -> 2D Canvas animation. Interaction -> Buttons trigger animations showing "position" vs. "offense". Justification -> Animation is crucial to demonstrate the rule at the "moment the ball is played," which a static image cannot do effectively. Method -> Native Canvas API.
        - Law 12 (Fouls): Report Info -> Categories of fouls and misconduct. Goal -> Organize large amounts of categorical data. Viz -> Tabbed interface for "Direct Kick," "Indirect Kick," "Cautions," "Send-Offs." Interaction -> Clicking tabs reveals specific offenses. Justification -> Prevents a long, intimidating wall of text and allows for focused exploration. Method -> JS for tab switching.
        - Rule Categories (Overview): Report Info -> The 17 Laws. Goal -> Provide a high-level summary of the rulebook's structure. Viz -> Doughnut Chart. Interaction -> Hover to see category name and law count. Justification -> Gives a visual, data-driven entry point to the application's structure. Library -> Chart.js.
        - Restarts (Laws 8, 15, 16, 17): Report Info -> Procedural steps. Goal -> Explain procedures. Viz -> Simple diagrams (HTML/CSS) with accompanying text. Interaction -> Accordion-style reveal. Justification -> A clean, simple way to present procedural information without over-complicating the interface. Method -> JS for toggles. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
